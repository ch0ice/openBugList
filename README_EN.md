# openBugList
* [中文版](./README.md)

OpenBugList is a project that collects software bugs in the open source community. You can easily find bugs in OpenBugList (I hope so), and their corresponding versions, problem phenomena, and solutions. If you don't find the bug you encounter in OpenBugList, I hope that after you solve the bug you encounter, you will submit the information of the bug to OpenBugLis in the format specified in OpenBugList for sharing (if it is a bug in open source software).
